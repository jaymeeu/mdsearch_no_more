## What I built
I built an Airbnb clone, an home provider platform where different home providers (hosts) add homes to the platform where home seekers can see a list of homes added by the hosts, the app is developed using NextJS for the front end and NodeJS(ExpressJS) for the back end.
I built the search functionality, search autocomplete, home filters and many more features with the `MongoDB Atlas`.
